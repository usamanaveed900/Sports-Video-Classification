# Sports Video Classification

### Overview
Sports classification has considerable importance for digital content archiving in broadcasting companies. It is also a subdivision of human action recognition, which further contributes to understand the context of video scenes. In this work, deep neural networks are used, to classify 15 individual sports classes.

### Dataset
The Dataset can be download from the link below :


#### Test Data Split
Collected data are split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 75%:25%.

|               |   X   |   Y   |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Training      | 3451  | 3451  |
| Testing       | 1151  | 1151  |
| Total         | 4602  | 4602  |

### Required Libraries
* keras - a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow
* OpenCV - Open Computer Vision Library
* numpy - the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* sklearn - a software machine learning library
* tensorflow - an open source machine learning framework for everyone

### How to Run
To run the `Train.ipynb` iPython notebook that contains all the code, please run the following line in the project directory:
```sh
$ jupyter notebook
```
